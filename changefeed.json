            "description": "Lagoon now supports Harbor version 2.13.x, keeping you current with the latest container registry features. This release also cleans up legacy configuration—the internal_container_registry variable has been removed from the API and database as part of ongoing Harbor deprecation work. Heads up: the QoS-related Helm values (lagoonFeatureFlagEnableQoS, QoSMaxBuilds, QoSDefault) are being phased out. They still work for now, but check out the new options in the lagoon-build-deploy chart before the next release.",
