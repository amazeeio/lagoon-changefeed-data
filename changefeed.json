            "description": "This release introduces support for external database servers for API and Keycloak databases, giving platform operators more flexibility in their infrastructure setup. A new beta UI is now available for preview—disabled by default but can be enabled via Helm values. Note: Bitbucket sync and Open Distro integrations have been fully removed following their deprecation in 2.29.0.",

            "description": "The 2.29 series marks the end of development for the current UI, with focus shifting to the new beta interface. Bitbucket and Open Distro sync scripts are deprecated and will be removed in the next major release—users should migrate to lagoon-opensearch-sync. Version 2.29.2 is the recommended release, as it fixes MariaDB client issues that caused API errors when accessing environment storage data.",

            "title": "Lagoon 2.28.0 - Harbor 2.13.x Support & Configuration Cleanup",
            "description": "Lagoon now supports Harbor version 2.13.x, keeping you current with the latest container registry features. This release also cleans up legacy configuration—the internal_container_registry variable has been removed from the API and database as part of ongoing Harbor deprecation work. Heads up: the QoS-related Helm values (lagoonFeatureFlagEnableQoS, QoSMaxBuilds, QoSDefault) are being phased out. They still work for now, but check out the new options in the lagoon-build-deploy chart before the next release.",

            "title": "Lagoon 2.27.0 - Retention Policies & Smarter Build Queues",
            "description": "This release brings retention policies to help manage your project data lifecycle, giving platform owners more control over cleanup automation. We've also upgraded the AWS S3 library—if you're using AWS buckets, you may need to set your region in the helm values. New installations now benefit from a streamlined setup process with initial platform-owner and organization configuration. On the build side, the remote-controller now handles queues more efficiently by letting completed builds move to a secondary queue, so new builds aren't stuck waiting behind long-running tasks.",
